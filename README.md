Created Unity project to experiment with Microsoft Latest MRTK 3 with utilization of Unity's Articulation-Robot-Demo: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/articulations-robot-demo.git. 

Modifed GripperDemoController.cs & PincherController.cs C# scripts and wired up those scripts to MRTK 3's latest UI Asssets for controlling robot manipulation movement and grips from user panel
